# Learn Swift and Kotlin in Parallel

![alt tag](https://github.com/ahmed-adel-said/learn-kotlin-swift/blob/master/Kotlin-Swift.png)

Swift and Kotlin are two great languages for iOS and Android development respectively. They both have very modern features and syntax that can help enormously to build native apps. But, how do they both compare to each other? Are they similar? Can we reuse more code between platforms if we adopt them in our projects? 

In this series, we are going to learn Swift and Kotlin from beginner to advanced in parallel by giving the same examples.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Getting Started :
 1. Basics (Swift and [Kotlin](https://github.com/ahmed-adel-said/learn-kotlin-swift/tree/master/Kotlin/src/com/ahmedadel/kotlin/basics))
 2. Functions.
 3. Classes.
 4. Implementing Object Oriented Programming.
 5. Null Safety.
 6. Casting.
 7. Get more familiar with Standard Library of Swift and Kotlin.

# Tools you need :
1. For Testing Swift code : 
	
	a. [Swift Sandbox Tool](https://swift.sandbox.bluemix.net/#/repl)
	
	b. [Rextester for Swift](http://rextester.com/l/swift_online_compiler)
2. For Testing Kotlin code :
	
	a. [Try Kotlin Tool](https://try.kotlinlang.org/#/Examples/Hello,%20world!/Simplest%20version/Simplest%20version.kt) 
	
	b. [Rextester for Kotlin](http://rextester.com/l/kotlin_online_compiler)

# Contributing :

We want to make this repository very useful and up-to-date. So, if you want to contribute to this learning series and make it better, your help is very welcome. Contributing is also a great way to learn more about social coding on Github, new technologies and and their ecosystems and how to make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests and the noblest of all contributions: a good, clean pull request.

## How to make a clean pull request

- Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on! Branch from `develop` if it exists, else from `master`.
- Add/Implement/Fix your feature, comment your code.
- Follow the code style of the project.
- Add or change the documentation as needed.
- Update/Add the README.md with details of changes you made.
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's `develop` branch if there is one, else go for `master`.
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete
your extra branch(es).
